you said towers are fixed and live forever : isnt that counter intuitive with a smol grid

you said that tower will only attack when wonbies already started attacking ; that is very harsh for the player, punishing them more 

contradictions ; you said towers can be damaged but they live forever 

walls could be a thing if implemented properly
